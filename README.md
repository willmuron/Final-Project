# Phylogenetic Analysis of Antifungal Resistance Genes in *Candida auris*

## 🧬 Project Overview
This project investigates the evolutionary relationships among antifungal resistance genes in the fungal pathogen *Candida auris*. We focus on genes such as **ERG11**, **FKS1**, and **CDR1**, which are commonly associated with resistance to antifungal medications. Using bioinformatics tools, we perform multiple sequence alignment and construct phylogenetic trees to identify mutations and clustering patterns.

## 🧠 Biological Problem
*Candida auris* is an emerging, multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen responsible for hospital outbreaks and invasive infections. The rapid global spread and difficulty in treatment make it a public health concern. By studying the evolution of its resistance genes, we aim to better understand its resistance mechanisms and potential transmission pathways.

"How have antifungal resistance genes in Candida auris evolved, and what mutations are associated with resistance in different clinical isolates?"

## 🧪 Hypothesis
We hypothesize that resistant strains of *C. auris* will:
- Contain shared mutations in key resistance genes.
- Cluster together in phylogenetic trees based on sequence similarity.

## 🎯 Goals and Objectives
- Collect antifungal resistance gene sequences from publicly available *C. auris* genomes.
- Perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using MAFFT or MUSCLE.
- Construct phylogenetic trees using RAxML or FastTree.
- Identify clustering patterns and evolutionary trends associated with resistance.
